# Observability Plan (ADR 0026)

Remaining work + standing invariants for event-based observability with
OpenTelemetry, tracking
[ADR 0026](docs/adr/0026-event-based-observability-with-opentelemetry.md).
A span is a wide event; spans are fat, not many thin logs.

## Shipped

Producer steps 1–3 (command dispatch span; event-store append/load spans;
`traceparent` into event metadata) and consumer steps 5–6 (new-trace-per-handler
+ span link back to the producer + `processing.lag_ms`) are live. The consumer
`TracingEventHandler` is applied by the `ConsumerRunner` to every discovered
projection *and processor*, so instrumentation is uniform without per-projection
wiring. The first **processor→command fan-out** (the `StorefrontOpener`) is
bounded as ADR 0026 anticipated: the dispatched command and its appended event
run on the opener's own consumer trace (a child of the handle span), linked back
to the request rather than threading the request trace through. Commits

## Remaining

4. **Per-type intent/outcome attributes** — adapter-side per-type extractors in
   `apps/api` (allow-list per command/event type; exact-match-tested = the PII
   guard). Dispatch span ← the command (what the user tried to do); append span
   ← the events (what happened). **No handler span** — handlers live in
   `packages/market-days`, which stays OTel-free *and* telemetry-free (purity).
   Deferred until the first content-rich command: `RegisterVendor` is
   content-thin (`vendorId` = identity → append span; `registeredAt` = clock;
   `email` = PII), so the generic spans stayed generic — no speculative extractors.

- **`QueryDispatcher` span** — when the read/query surface lands (`GET /storefront`,
  plan "B" in `PLAN.md`), mirror `CommandDispatcher` (same decorator + ESLint
  guard) but lighter: span only, no lineage, no append (reads cause nothing).
  Must follow the Attribute policy below.

## Deferred (per ADR)

- OTel **Collector** and **tail-based sampling** — until volume warrants
  (`docs/DEFERRED.md`).

## Testing harness (established)

Hermetic span capture: a test-only `NodeTracerProvider` + `InMemorySpanExporter`
+ `SimpleSpanProcessor`, registered **once** (the global provider is set-once per
process) with `exporter.reset()` between tests; **no auto-instrumentation**, so
`getFinishedSpans()` holds only our spans.

**Synthetic for mechanism, real-domain only for content-bearing spans.** The
generic tracing machinery — new-trace/link/lag, the no-link fallback, failure
paths — is parametric over event/command type, so it's tested with a **synthetic**
event at the decorator unit level (`tracing.event-handler.spec.ts`). Coupling it
to a domain flow only makes it brittle to that domain's rules (an unrelated
`assert-opened` once broke a consumer tracing test). A **real-domain** social test
earns its keep only where exact-match attributes are a genuine PII guard — a span
*handed a content-bearing message*. Today that is the dispatch span proven blind
to `RegisterVendor`'s `email` (`command-dispatch-tracing.spec.ts`); the deferred
content-rich handler span will be the next. The consumer path keeps one thin
**wiring** smoke test (`storefront-consumer-tracing.spec.ts`) — that the
`ConsumerRunner` wraps a discovered projection — and nothing more. Failure paths
are driven by a stub whose inner `append`/`handle` throws.

## Attribute policy — default-rich, PII-safe by seam

Wide events are the point: *put on everything you can think of* (Charity Majors)
— you can't predict which dimension cracks the next unknown-unknown, and
high-cardinality domain context is exactly what `BubbleUp` / `group by` need. So
the default is **rich, not minimal**: attach any non-PII context already in hand.
(Note: "no speculative surface" is a rule about *code surface* — facades, methods
that rot. A span attribute is *data*, not surface; it doesn't transfer.)

Two seams, chosen so richness never costs domain purity or leaks PII:

- **Bus / store span** — opens the wide event from *ambient* `MessageContext`
  metadata + the message's constructor name (`command.name`, `event.type`,
  `vendor.id`, correlation/causation). It is **structurally blind to the
  message's fields**, so it cannot serialize a payload — no `JSON.stringify`
  footgun, no accidental `email`.
- **Command handler** — the application-layer seam that *does* hold the command,
  resulting state, and emitted event in scope. Domain attributes (sizes, states,
  outcomes) are added here, **explicitly, one `setAttribute` at a time**. Pure
  domain packages still never import OTel.

Why this is safe: there is **no automatic serialization path** anywhere. Every
attribute is a deliberate, reviewable line — the default is empty and you opt in
per field. That structurally prevents *accidental bulk* leakage (dumping a whole
command/event). It does **not** prevent a deliberate mistake (explicitly stamping
`email`); that is caught by review against this policy, not by the mechanism.

**Excluded / projected:** never put PII on a span (`email`, personal names,
phone). Sensitive-but-useful values go on as a **derived projection** — a bucket
(`amount.bucket`), count, boolean, or hash — never the raw value. Free text
(business descriptions, blurbs) is unbounded-cardinality and not aggregable:
leave it off unless a concrete need arises.

**Caveat to revisit:** `vendor.id` rides every span as the high-cardinality key.
It's a business handle today, which is acceptable. **If the vendor identity
scheme ever becomes an email or a person's name, this policy breaks** — treat
that change as a trigger to re-evaluate.

## Domain-purity invariant (ADR)

Instrumentation only ever extends the `@nestjs/cqrs` bus and the
store/subscription **adapters**. The domain packages gain **no** observability
dependency. Hold this line on every step above.
