# Customer Frontend — Public Storefront (vitrine)

Per-vendor public storefront at `{subdomain}.votreplateforme.fr`, rendering one vendor's storefront, catalogue, and upcoming markets. App: `apps/customer-frontend` (Angular SSR). Design: `docs/design/customer-frontend-1.png`, `-2.png`, `-show-dish.png`. Outside-in social TDD, thin vertical slices, backend-first ([[feedback_testing_approach]], [[feedback_incremental_steps_review_gates]]).

## Architecture (resolved)

**No new persisted read model or projection.** The page composes existing/planned persisted read models at read time behind one public endpoint. The only new server state is a subdomain→vendor lookup table.

| Screen region | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Header/footer — name, tagline, phone, cover | `VendorStorefrontViews.findByVendor` | built, reused — **wired (slice 1)** |
| NOTRE CARTE — dishes | `CatalogueViews.forVendor` | built, reused (retired items already vanish from the view) |
| PROCHAIN / PROCHAINS MARCHÉS | `FindUpcomingMarketDays(vendorId)` | **built** (`docs/MARKET-SCHEDULE-PLAN.md` §"Upcoming market days") — vendor-authed route only; public exposure is slice 3 |
| subdomain → vendorId | `subdomain_registry` table | **built (slice 1)** |

Composition: `GET /public/storefront/:subdomain` (public, no auth) resolves the subdomain, fans out to the three read models, returns one `CustomerStorefront` result — **a discriminated union** gated on publication (`published` | `coming-soon`), or 404 (see Publication gate). SSR fetches a single URL. Read-time compute is confined to the start-time cutoff; everything else is a view read.

## Subdomain resolution

- `subdomain_registry(subdomain TEXT PRIMARY KEY, vendor_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE)` — `subdomain` PK is both the reservation guard and the resolution lookup; stored lowercase, normalized (`.toLowerCase()`) at the api boundary (DNS is case-insensitive). `vendor_id UNIQUE` = one subdomain per vendor, so `removeFor` is deterministic.
- **Authoritative write-model table, not a projection** — not rebuilt from events. A projection would reintroduce the uniqueness race the unique index exists to prevent.
- **No event, no command in v1. Rows manually seeded.** A `SubdomainAssigned` event + reservation-on-command arrive only when a vendor chooses/renames their URL — that command's handler writes the table and emits the event together. Until then the table is the sole authority; only the writer evolves (operator → command → vendor), never the table.
- Resolution: `SELECT vendor_id WHERE subdomain = $1`; miss → 404.
- Erasure ([[project_vendor_erasure_scope]], ADR 0025): `SubdomainRegistry.removeFor(vendorId)` is wired into `VendorErasure.erase()` (**new work, slice 1** — the registry is a new table erasure didn't previously know) → row deleted → storefront 404s. No SHREDDED-sentinel guard in the customer handler; row deletion is the sole defence. Without it the rebuilt storefront view renders the `<shredded>` sentinel (`name/phone = '<shredded>'`) on a public page.

## DTO

```
CustomerStorefront =
  | { status: 'published';
      name, description, phone,
      coverPhoto?,                               // raw Cloudinary public-id — frontend builds the URL (see Image refs gotcha)
      dishes: [{ id, name, description, price, photo? }],
      upcomingMarkets: [{ date, weekday, marketName, startTime?, endTime?,
                          street?, postalCode, town, pitch? }] }
  | { status: 'coming-soon'; name: string | null }   // resolves but unpublished; 404 = unresolved (see Publication gate)
```

- Discriminated union on `status`; the frontend branches (published page / coming-soon page / `null`→introuvable). Only `published` carries the rich fields.
- `nextMarket` (PROCHAIN MARCHÉ) = `upcomingMarkets[0]` — no separate field.
- `upcomingMarkets` = `FindUpcomingMarketDays` occurrences, minus in-progress (start-time cutoff below), first ~5.
- Image fields (`coverPhoto`, dish `photo`) are raw Cloudinary public-ids, not URLs — the frontend builds delivery URLs (no server-side builder exists).

## Publication gate (ADR 0031)

A storefront is public only once the vendor **publishes** it — a deliberate go-live, gated on readiness. Full rationale in ADR 0031; the shape:

- **`published` is a state on the `Storefront` aggregate** (`StorefrontPublished`). Vendor intent, not "data happens to exist."
- **Readiness is a cross-aggregate policy → the stateless `StorefrontPublication` domain service** (not the aggregate reaching across boundaries). Synchronous; an async request/confirm processor was rejected (it would only wrap the same reads). Each aggregate answers neutral self-queries; the service owns the required set + reason words and assembles `missing[]`:

  | Contributor | Query | Reason |
  |---|---|---|
  | Storefront | `hasTitle()` / `hasDescription()` / `hasCoverPhoto()` | `title` / `description` / `cover` |
  | Catalogue | `hasAtLeastOneItem()` | `catalogue` |
  | Calendar | `hasSchedule()` | `schedule` |

- **`Storefront.publish()` guards only local rules** (open, idempotent) + raises the event; the service gates readiness → `StorefrontNotReadyToPublish(missing)` (extends `DomainError` → 400 with reasons). Thin handler: load storefront/catalogue/calendar, delegate, save the storefront (one aggregate mutated, one event — ADR 0009).
- **Cover mandatory to publish, not to edit** — consistent with description (`StorefrontDescription` allows empty, so `hasDescription()` checks content, not a fired flag). Readiness ≠ validity; the gate is in the service, never the VOs.
- **Read gate**: the composite returns the discriminated union — 404 (subdomain unresolved) / coming-soon (resolves, unpublished; title if set, `noindex`) / published — on a `published` flag projected into `vendor-storefront-view`. Erasure already deletes the subdomain row → an erased vendor is 404, not coming-soon (correct).
- **Subscription** (once charging): one more self-query behind a local entitlement projection — deferred, `docs/DEFERRED.md`.

## Decisions (don't re-litigate)

- **Reuse over refold.** The customer view composes the three persisted read models; no read-time event-store fold, no bespoke customer projection. The three sources have no cross-join in v1 (menu chips cut), so their independent lag composes one page without inconsistency (ADR 0002).
- **Markets read the shared model, not a customer BFF expansion.** Expansion + retraction (cancel/skip) live once in `FindUpcomingMarketDays`. A BFF expansion off the Calendrier view was **rejected**: it duplicates the `Schedule` VO cadence math and — without cancel/skip — asserts false future attendance on a customer surface (a shopper sent to an empty pitch). Buys no performance either: `FindUpcomingMarketDays` also expands at query time.
- **Start-time cutoff is customer-side presentation.** Drop occurrences whose start (`date` + `startTime`, hardcoded `Europe/Paris`) has passed. The in-progress window belongs to a future active-market-day interface (MarketDay "in progress" lifecycle); vendor reads of the same model keep in-progress days, so this filter stays in the customer layer, not the read model. `Europe/Paris` is a single-region calibration constant → becomes a `Market` timezone attribute when multi-region.
- **Menu chips per market: cut.** Cards show date/market/hours/address only — no "Menu à venir" placeholder (nothing behind it). The dish↔market-day join is the separate prepared-state overlay slice (`docs/MARKET-SCHEDULE-PLAN.md`).
- **Categories + tags: cut.** Domain has neither; deferred as `ItemAddedToCatalogue` v2 (`docs/CATALOGUE-PLAN.md`). Dish card + modal show name/description/price/photo only.
- **Dish detail modal: no endpoint.** Opens client-side from `dishes[]`; "Disponible les jours de marché…" is static copy, not a data field.
- **404 on unresolved subdomain; coming-soon on unpublished** (see Publication gate). For a *published* storefront: empty catalogue/schedule → empty arrays; missing cover can't happen (cover is a publish requirement).
- **Composite query, thin controller.** One `FindCustomerStorefront(subdomain)` handler injects the `SubdomainRegistry` port + the view ports, resolves then composes the DTO, returns `undefined` on miss; `PublicStorefrontController` is one `execute()` + `null→404`. Subdomain resolution is a plain port method (`vendorFor`), **not** its own CQRS query. Fan-out + the start-time cutoff live in the handler, not the controller.
- **Angular, not Astro.** Astro — already in the monorepo (`apps/website`) and a better raw fit for a static vitrine — was considered and **rejected**: the near-term roadmap (semi-real-time dish availability, then ordering + payment) makes this a transactional, stateful app, which is Angular's wheelhouse and consistent with `vendor-frontend`'s NgRx/Signal-Forms stack. Astro would need an island framework bolted in and likely a later rewrite. The CSS design system is portable either way, and `render.yaml` already wires the customer SSR node service.

## Dependency

**Slice 3 (markets) is no longer blocked** (verified 2026-07-15 against the code). The `docs/MARKET-SCHEDULE-PLAN.md` §"Upcoming market days" dependency shipped: read half (`FindUpcomingMarketDays` — real cadence expansion over a 56-day horizon + absence flagging, tested at every layer incl. a Postgres container) and write half (`CancelMarketSchedule` retires a whole schedule; **`DeclareAbsence`** — the plan's provisional "SkipMarketDay" — skips a day or range, single day = `from == to`). What remains is slice 3's own composition, **not** a market-schedule prerequisite: `FindUpcomingMarketDays` is exposed only on the vendor-authed `GET /market-schedules/upcoming`, so the public composite must fold it in (reuse the handler's expansion, don't duplicate). All three slices can now proceed independently.

## Build order — vertical tracer-bullet slices, outside-in TDD, review gate each

**Slice 1 — resolve + storefront (the tracer bullet). ✅ Shipped** — built in order 1 → 2 → 4 → 3, plus a dev seed; five commits (registry · endpoint · erasure · SSR · dev seed). Proven live at `localhost:4200/?subdomain=demo`.
1. `subdomain_registry` migration (DDL only — empty table, PK + `UNIQUE(vendor_id)`; **no seed**, rows hand-inserted per env) + `SubdomainRegistry` port (`vendorFor`/`removeFor`) with Postgres/InMemory adapters.
2. `GET /public/storefront/:subdomain` acceptance (RED): 404 on miss → storefront-view fields on hit. Public, exempt from the vendor auth guard.
3. SSR: Angular resolver injects `REQUEST` → `Host` → subdomain (first-label split; `?subdomain=` fallback on localhost) → fetch → render header/footer. Response → TransferState via `provideClientHydration`; add `customer-frontend` env for `apiBaseUrl`.
4. Erasure: extend `vendor-erasure.spec` — erased vendor's subdomain no longer resolves; add the `removeFor` call to `VendorErasure`.

Proves the whole pipe DNS→SSR→api→resolve→view→render, thinnest path.

**Slice 2 — catalogue.**
5. Extend endpoint/DTO with `CatalogueViews.forVendor` dishes.
6. Frontend NOTRE CARTE list + dish detail sheet (opened client-side from list data).

**Slice 3 — markets (unblocked; the market-schedule dependency shipped — see Dependency).**
7. Fold `upcomingMarkets` into the public `CustomerStorefront` (the expansion query is currently vendor-authed only — reuse its expansion, don't duplicate); apply the customer start-time cutoff; `nextMarket = [0]`.
8. Frontend PROCHAIN MARCHÉ card + PROCHAINS MARCHÉS list (date badge, hours, address).

**Slice 4 — publication gate (ADR 0031).** Backend build order 9→13 is independent of slices 2/3; the demo only renders *published* once dishes + schedules are seeded (needs 2/3's seed work).
9. `Storefront`: store name/description in `apply`; `hasTitle()`/`hasDescription()`/`hasCoverPhoto()`; `publish()` (open + idempotent, raises `StorefrontPublished`). Add `StorefrontDescription.hasContent()`, `CoverPhoto.isSet()`. Aggregate tests.
10. Sibling readiness: `Catalogue.hasAtLeastOneItem()`, `Calendar.hasSchedule()`. Tests.
11. `StorefrontPublication` service + `PublishStorefront` command/handler (vendor-authed): assemble `missing`, throw `StorefrontNotReadyToPublish` (→400) or publish. Acceptance test — not-ready → 400 + reasons; ready → `StorefrontPublished`.
12. Project `StorefrontPublished` → `vendor-storefront-view.published`; `FindCustomerStorefront` returns the discriminated union (404 / coming-soon / published). Extend the public-endpoint acceptance test for all three states.
13. Frontend: resolver union → `ComingSoonPage` + `StorefrontPage` branch, `noindex` on coming-soon. Render the cover `<img>` (built URL; `NgOptimizedImage` later). Extend `seedDev`: description + cover (`v1784235195/demo-cover_ghvwt5`) + dish + schedule + publish.
14. (Own slice, later) Vendor-frontend publish button surfacing the missing-reasons.

**Publish-storefront TDD cycles** — steps 9–11's write side is driven outside-in by one social spec (`test/src/market-days/publish-storefront/publish-storefront.spec.ts`); the aggregate, VO, service and command emerge together, one RED→GREEN per cycle:
- [x] 1 — not-ready storefront → `StorefrontNotReadyToPublish` (tracer: command/handler/service/`hasTitle()`/error)
- [x] 2 — title set, empty description → not ready (`hasDescription()` + `StorefrontDescription.hasContent()` + apply `StorefrontInformationEdited` storing name/description)
- [x] 3 — no cover → not ready (`hasCoverPhoto()` + `CoverPhoto.isSet()`)
- [x] 4 — no dishes → not ready (handler loads `Catalogue` + `hasAtLeastOneItem()`)
- [ ] 5 — no schedule → not ready (`Calendar.hasSchedule()`)
- [ ] 6 — all met → `StorefrontPublished` emitted (`Storefront.publish()`: open + idempotent + raise)
- [ ] 7 — re-publish → single event (idempotent)
- [ ] 8 — assert full `missing[]` reasons + vendorId metadata (`expectVendorScopedEvents`)

## Gotchas / open

- **Public route must bypass the vendor auth guard.** Verify the guard's scoping and confirm `/public/storefront/:subdomain` doesn't collide with existing controller routes when building slice 1.
- **Dev subdomains.** Wildcard DNS (`*.votreplateforme.fr`) is provisioned for prod; on `localhost` (Host carries no subdomain) the resolver falls back to a `?subdomain=` query param. `DEV_SUBDOMAIN` env deferred — avoids `process.env` plumbing in SSR/browser-shared code; add only if the query param gets tedious. The api never reads `Host` — it always receives a real `:subdomain` param.
- **PII on a public surface by design.** storefront-view name/description/phone are shown (phone in the footer). Shredded vendor handled by erasure deleting the subdomain row, not a view guard.
- **Image URLs.** No server-side URL builder exists (only `vendor-frontend`'s `cloudinary-url.pipe`). The DTO returns raw Cloudinary public-ids (`imageReference`); the customer-frontend builds delivery URLs client-side, mirroring that pipe ([[project_cover_photo_upload]]). Keeps multiple transforms per image (card thumb vs modal) available for slice 2; `cloudName` is public.
- **Open — read-model overlap.** `FindUpcomingMarketDays` and the Calendrier view store near-identical rows (schedule snapshot keyed `(vendorId, scheduleId)`); a one-model/two-queries consolidation is possible but touches shipped Calendrier code — deferred to `docs/MARKET-SCHEDULE-PLAN.md`.
- **Dev seed.** `seedDev(app)` (`apps/api/src/app/dev-seed.ts`, `NODE_ENV=development` / memory profile only) opens a `demo-vendor` storefront and registers the `demo` subdomain after `listen`, so `localhost:4200/?subdomain=demo` renders with no manual seeding. Opens the storefront directly (not via `RegisterVendor`) so the `OpensStorefronts` processor never races `drain()` under polling. Never runs on postgres/prod. **Slice 4:** the publish gate means the demo must also seed a description + cover (`v1784235195/demo-cover_ghvwt5`) + ≥1 dish + ≥1 schedule, then `PublishStorefront` — otherwise `?subdomain=demo` renders coming-soon.
- **Cover image.** Now a **publish requirement** (ADR 0031), so a published storefront always has one; rendered in slice 4 from the built Cloudinary URL (customer-frontend needs `cloudinary.cloudName` in its env, mirroring vendor-frontend). `NgOptimizedImage` + `provideCloudinaryLoader` is a later LCP refinement.

## Status & next steps

**Slice 1 shipped** — subdomain registry, public endpoint, erasure row-deletion, SSR storefront tracer, dev seed. Header/footer renders end to end (DNS→SSR→api→resolve→view→render), proven live.

Possible next steps (unordered):
- **Slice 2 — catalogue.** `CatalogueViews.forVendor` → DTO `dishes[]`; NOTRE CARTE list + client-side dish sheet. Extend `seedDev` with demo dishes.
- **Slice 3 — markets.** **Unblocked** — `FindUpcomingMarketDays` + `CancelMarketSchedule`/`DeclareAbsence` all shipped and tested. Remaining work is composition: expose the (vendor-authed) expansion on the public storefront — fold `upcomingMarkets` into `CustomerStorefront`, apply the customer start-time cutoff, `nextMarket = [0]`, render the cards.
- **Slice 4 — publication gate (ADR 0031).** `PublishStorefront` + `StorefrontPublication` readiness service; `published` projection; discriminated-union read gate (404 / coming-soon / published); cover render. Backend is independent of 2/3; the *demo* renders published only once 2/3 seed dishes + schedules. Build order steps 9–14.
- **Styling / design pass.** Bring the tracer up to `docs/design/customer-frontend-*.png`; render the cover via `NgOptimizedImage` + Cloudinary loader.
- **Real-time availability** (roadmap). Live dish sold-out/available (WS/SSE + signals) — introduces client state, likely NgRx per project convention.
- **Ordering + payment** (later roadmap). Cart, customer auth, checkout, payment — the transactional turn that kept this on Angular.
- **Prod deploy.** `render.yaml` already defines the SSR node service on `*.marketmiam.fr`; needs real wildcard DNS + the first `subdomain_registry` rows inserted by hand per env.
- **`SubdomainAssigned` command** (v2). When vendors self-select/rename their URL: reservation-on-command writes the table and emits the event together.
